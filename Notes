Google AllStar :

- Github App from goole and Open Source Security Foundation

- it allows to enforce policies on Github repositories so to avoid basic misconfigurations

- When Allstar app indentifies that a repo is out of compliance ( violating any policy )
  then it can either :

  - Log the failure and do nothing 

  - Can open a github issue 

  - Or can automatically fix issue -> which makes easier for developers


CAn set policies at org level or repo level 

- first need to intall the app in github

-  need to create repo of name .allstar.
   and files ( allstar.yml , branch_protection.yml ,   outside.yml , security.yml )
